<h1>Hi!</h1>
  <p>I am Christian Niederauer, a PhD candidate at AMOLF (Amsterdam) in the group of Physics of Cellular Interactions (Dr. Kristina Ganzinger).</p>
<p>I am developing and using single-molecule microscopy to study immunoreceptors. Along the way, I enjoy solving smaller and bigger technical problems creatively and innovatively, developing custom 3D-printed parts or small-scale custom electronical and mechanical tools. </p>
